# OdinProject-RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors project from TheOdinProject

Post Project Reflection:

This was a fun project to get my hands into as it was my first time using the JavaScript
that I've learnt through TheOdinProject.

One of my biggest takeaways from this project is not to overthink, I found myself
trying to find solutions to my problems and thinking outside the box to do so when 
the answers were usually inside the box and at my disposal the entire time.

Nevertheless I had a great time completing this project and I'm excited to come back to
it in the future and see what I can improve on.
